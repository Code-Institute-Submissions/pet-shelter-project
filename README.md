Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Front-end Development â€“ Code Institute

This website was made as my first milestone project for the Code Institute course. The website was created for a fictional pet shelter and the project requirements were to create a static front-end website using HTML and CSS.

## User experience design (UXD)

### Strategy

#### Goal

The goals for the (fictional) website owner would be to raise more awareness of their existence, get more people to know that they exist. This would result in more clients and therefore possibly more income. Another goal that this website would accomplish is better and more efficient contact between them and their clients.

The goal in regards to users is to provide them a website to allow for easy access to information, provide clear and simple contact details and show an overview of all pets that are available for adoption.

#### User stories

- As **someone looking to adopt a pet**, I would like **to see an overview of all pets that are available for adoption**, so that **I don't have to travel there to find out if there is anything available that I'm looking for**.

- As **someone looking to adopt a pet**, I would like **to see images of all pets that are available for adoption**, so that **I can decide if it's worth visiting the shelter**.

- As **someone looking to adopt/let go of a pet**, I would like **an easy to fill in contact form**, so that **I can contact the pet shelter to get answers to any questions that I have**.

- As **someone looking to adopt/let go of a pet**, I would like **to know the pet shelters' address information**, so that **I know how to travel there**.

- As **someone looking to let go of a pet**, I would like **clear and concise information about letting go of a pet**, so that **I can get a good understanding of what the process is like**.

- As a **site owner**, I would like our website **to have an intuitive navigation system**, so that **visitors can easily access all available information**.

- As a **site owner**, I would like our website **to have a contact form where clients can specify their needs**, so that **we prevent unnecessary customer support calls**.

### Scope

#### Functional specifications

The website should have a navigation bar. When the user clicks on the logo it should go back to the homepage. Content on the website should support different screensizes. Wherever appropriate and or possible, visible indicators should be shown to users when they can perform an action on the website (like clicking a link or a button).

#### Content requirements

The website needs to provide information about: the pet shelter, the process of adopting a pet and the process of letting go of a pet. The website needs to provide address and contact information. The website needs a seperate contact form where clients can specify their needs. The website needs a page that shows all pets that are available for adoption.

### Structure

#### Information architecture

The website uses what I would call a 'spider web structure', where every page is always just one click away. Most pages are accessible through the navigation bar at the top of the website, while some adoption sub-category pages are accessible in the footer on the bottom of the website. I tried making a diagram of the structure, but it ended up looking pretty horrible. If you'd like to see it click [here](wireframes/structure-tree.png).

#### Interaction design

Users can use the clickable elements in the navigation bar to browse through the website. Some visible indicators will tell the user at which page they currently are, while other visible indicators will alert users when they are hovering a link. Users with touchscreens can swipe up and down to scroll through the web pages and they can (double)tap to open links and browse through the website. There won't be any audio or video that users can interact with.

### Skeleton

The shape of the website will be pretty standard: a navigation bar at the top, the main content in the middle and a footer with some address info, extra navigation links and social media links at the bottom. The users will be able to get around the website by using the navigation bar, which will also have a clickable logo to go back to the frontpage. Users will also be able to use some more direct links in the footer to pages that are not presented in the navigation bar (for instance: sub categories for pet adoption). Most of the content will be presented in a grid-style layout. On smaller screensizes the layout will transform to a smaller number of columns to ensure readability and prevent deformations.

#### Wireframes

To see the wireframes in PDF click [here](wireframes/pet-shelter-wireframes.pdf).

### Surface

#### Colours

My plan was to use green, beige/off-white and dark blue/black colours for the website. I tried several different variations and settled on the ones shown in the image below. The contrast between them is pretty great, which ensures that everything is clearly readable.

#### Typography

I'm currently using the font-style 'Montserrat' from the Google Fonts library throughout the website. It just looks very clean and readable in my opinion.

#### Uniformity

To keep the website looking uniform I'm trying to making sure that all related contents throughout the website are consistent in font size and styling. The positioning of elements should be consistent in height, padding and spacing. I'm also using either grid, flexbox or both to present the content in a logical order.
